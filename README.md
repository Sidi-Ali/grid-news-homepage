## My process
I used a mobile-first workflow to complete this project.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript


### What I learned

My major learning while working through this project was using CSS Grid.

```CSS
body{
  display: grid;
}
```

### Continued development

I have used flexbox earlier for this same project. I decided to use CSS Grid for the first time in this project, and I found it to be awesome. So, going forward, I will use  flexbox when I need to design a layout in one dimension, either a row or a column. And I will use CSS Grid when I need to design a layout with two-dimensions (rows and columns at the same time).
